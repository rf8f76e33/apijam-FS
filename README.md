# Apigee API Jam - Financial Services

![](./header.png)

Find out how the world’s leading brands are using Apigee to power the world’s
leading APIs. Take advantage of this unique opportunity to start building
professional ­grade APIs using Apigee Edge. This hands-on workshop will teach
you how to easily expose existing backend assets as secure, scalable APIs that
developers will actually want to use. You’ll get a chance to explore the next
generation of app development and see how Apigee’s Backend­-as-­a-­Service
frees you from the bottlenecks of traditional IT operations. At the end of the
workshop, you’ll see how built­in mobile and social capabilities combine with the
power of Node.js to enable rapid development of modern apps.

**In this workshop, you will:**
* Build a high­ performance API out of an existing backend service using Apigee API Services
* Gain end­-to-­end visibility across your APIs from the user all the way to your backend using Apigee Analytics Services
* Understand how to quickly onboard developers and monetize your APIs using Apigee Developer Services


This is the supporting material for a one-day hands-on workshop that introduces developers to  Apigee Edge. We call it a "**Apigee API Jam**".
